Both are Robonova robots and are powered by a 5- cell NiMH battery with 6 volts. The 16 servos give incredible power and freedom of movement. The memory consists of an ATMEGA 128.")

With what I move is a broken hoverboard with costume BLDC- motor controllers and a costume Battery circuit. It is controlled with an Arduino via UART. But now here are Jakob and John.")
